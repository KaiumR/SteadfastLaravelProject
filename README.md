I have made this project based on the given three tasks. The first task was to create a user authentication mechanism and then make a seeder for user login, followed by a simple VAT calculator. In this project, I have created a custom authentication mechanism for the user. To use the VAT calculator, users have to log in to the site; if they don't have any accounts, they must create one to use the feature.

Please follow the steps to run the project on your local device.
1. Install Xamp, Wramp, or any other web server to maintain the database.
2. Create a database named "employee" and a table named "employee" to collect user data.
3. Set up a Laravel environment on your device.
4. Type "composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app" on the terminal to create a Laravel project.
5. Open the terminal and type the command "php artisan serve" to run the application.
6. Type (your _local_address/welcome) to open the first page of the project.
